SQL script list used in my daily work.

I did not created the most of it (big up to stackoverflow, msdn, brent Ozar, kendra little and the SQL World Wibe Web community) but i customized (or not) them for my own situation.

Since i created them for years i (unfortunately) did not have the reflex to source each piece of code.
